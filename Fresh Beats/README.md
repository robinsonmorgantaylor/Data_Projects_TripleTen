# Fresh Beats Status Report
This was a junior-level project to turn an analysis into a report presentation.

Fresh Beats is a music streaming platform catering to listeners and up-and-coming musicians. It offers music streaming and helps new artists gain exposure through promotional services. The platform faces challenges in optimizing these areas:
* Ensuring artist promotions are effective and deliver value for musicians.
* Converting free listeners into paying subscribers.
* Recommending music effectively, especially in highlighting new artists in relevant genres.

#### Data:
The data was one Google spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen:

    - `'year'`: year data was obtained for each dimension
    - `'user_tier'`: Boolean data categorizing if the users were Free or Paid Subscribers

    - `'number_of_users'`: The SUM of all users for each dimension
    - `'tracks_listened'`: The SUM of all music plays for each dimension

A Google Doc with a template for the project was provided. Blank Sections included:

- `'Visualizations'`
- `'Conclusion'`

#### Assumptions:

#### Findings:

User Engagement and Conversion:
- Paid users are more engaged: They listen to more music and show better retention. Converting free users to paid subscribers is a key strategy.
- Rock genre is popular amoung free users: Since rock is the primary genre for free users, explore and investigate further to determine how these users can be converted into paid subscribers.
- Artist Promotion Effectiveness and Genre Promotion for Emerging Artists: Pop music is declining and electronic and hip-hop are gaining traction. Fresh Beats should consider these trends when curating music and promoting artists.

    - Paid User Conversion: Offer promotions and tiered subscriptions to convert free users.
